The goal of this project is to define simple file system interface that allowes easy unit testing.

Instead of programming directky against File.Read, File.Write, FileReader and StreamReader/StreamWriter you can use this interaface, 
which will allow you to easily unit test your code without actually writing/reading to the file system.
